# Disparities Workshop

This repository contains notes, code, data, and exercises for a workshop on analytic methods for health disparities. The workshop will revolve around three projects. Each project will start with a brief lecture on concepts, methods, and context needed to complete the assignment. 

The three projects are increasingly complex. Starting with a simple simulated dataset with (mostly) binary variables, to a more complex setting with categorical exposures, mediators, and mixed type confounders. 

The tools and concepts covered in this workshop will include:

  - Data Import, and Wrangling
  - Exploratory Analyses
  - Regression Modeling
  - Counterfactual Disparity Measures
  - Bootstrapping
  - Robust Variance Estimation

All of these will be covered extensively through R code. By the end of this workshop, you should have the ability to deploy code in a reproducible fashion to implement these methods. 

The overall goal of this workshop is to enable you to deploy quantitative methods to answer specific questions pertaining to health disparities.
