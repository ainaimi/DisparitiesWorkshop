# Navigating the Day

.font150[

* Structure for Today

* Project 1: Counterfactual Disparity Measures in a Simple Setting

* Project 2: Counterfactual Disparity Measure in the NHEFS

* Project 3: Counterfactual Disparity Measure in the NUMOM2b Study


]

# Structure for Today

.font150[

* Starting at 8:30AM, wrapping up at 5:30PM
  - Several breaks throughout

* We'll start with a quick review

* We will carry out three projects
  - Each project will start with a brief "lecture style" overview with slides
  - Next, we will split up into groups and start setting up project folders and code writing

]

---

# Project Outline

* Project 1 
  - Simple setting with binary exposure, mediator, confounders, continuous outcome
  - Will enable us to become familiar with overall scope of tasks

* Project 2
  - Counterfactual Disparity Measure in the NHEFS
  - Binary exposure, binary outcome, three category mediator
  - Confounders: binary, categorical, continuous
  
* Project 3: 
  - Counterfactual Disparity Measure in the NUMOM2B Study
  - More complex exposure and mediator

---
# Tools Covered

.font150[

* We will cover several concepts throughout the day:

  - Data Import, and Wrangling
  - Exploratory Analyses
  - Regression Modeling
  - Counterfactual Disparity Measures
  - Bootstrapping
  - Robust Variance Estimation

* All of these will be covered through R code

* This will be a heavily applied session

]

---
# Goals

.font150[

- The end goal of each project will be to write two R programs:

  - A data management file that yields an analytic dataset
  - A main analysis file that yields a table of result 

- These R programs should serve as your references and starting points in future work
